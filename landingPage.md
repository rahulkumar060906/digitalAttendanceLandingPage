Badi classes me toh queue lag jaati hai. Students bore ho jaate hain, aur learning peeche reh jaati hai.  
Proxy attendance bhi ek problem hai. System purana lagta hai.  

**Tagline:**  
Attendance ka process simple hona chahiye — bas show up and mark.

## 📊 Comparison: Digital Card vs Biometrics

| Feature | Digital Attendance Card | Biometric System |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Speed** | Instant tap → 100+ students in 30 sec | Finger/face scan one by one → slow |
| **Setup Cost** | Minimal (software only) | High (hardware, maintenance) |
| **Scalability** | Works anywhere, anytime | Needs scanner in every class |
| **Flexibility** | Mobile/laptop friendly | Only physical presence |
| **Proxy Prevention** | Time-bound + geo-validation | Strong (unique biometrics) |
| **Privacy** | No sensitive data stored | Biometric data risk |
| **Eco-Friendly** | 100% digital | Hardware footprint |

**Takeaway:**  
👉 Digital Cards = fast, affordable, flexible.  
Biometrics = secure but costly & complex.  
Our system finds the balance — **fair + future-ready**.
